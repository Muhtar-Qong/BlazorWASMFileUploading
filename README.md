# BlazorWASMFileUploading
In this project, we will discuss file uploads in Blazor WebAssembly app. The process will be 
done as follows:
1. Create a Blazor WebAssembly Hosted App.
2. Create an “UploadedFile” class in the Shared Project. 
3. Create a “FileUpload” controller in the Sever project.
4. Create a “FileUploading” razor component in the Client project.
5. Call the “FileUploading” razor component in the side navigation bar of the client application.
6. Finally, run the application and test upload some files.

(Notice: first run the API project, the BlazorWASMFileUploading.Server, then copy the URL
and paste it in the appsettings.json file in the BlazorWASMFileUploading.Client project).
